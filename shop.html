		<p>These are some of the supplements and tools that have helped me the most on my journey of healing and recovering from insomnia, exhaustion, burnout and an acquired anxiety disorder.</p>
		<p>These are part of the essential arsenal of optimizing life or recovering from trauma and crisis, cultivating inner peace and vitality, positive attitude and resilient mindset. The other components are information (mental transformation) and practices (physical and emotional transformation).</p>
