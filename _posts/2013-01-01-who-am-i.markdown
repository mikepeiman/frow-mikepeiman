This website, hosted under my own name, is intended as a platform for me to share my views, for the purpose of representing myself as truly as possible, and importantly, as a platform for providing value to the world. 

I am a lifelong learner, a deep systems thinker and a big-picture visionary. I believe much of my greatest contribution to the world is in the form of my insights and ideas. I expect that the messages I share via this website will become a major piece of my work in the world.
