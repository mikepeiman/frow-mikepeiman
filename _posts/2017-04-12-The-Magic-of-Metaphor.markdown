<p class="lead-paragraph"><span class="dropcap-box"><span class="dropcap">T</span></span>he power of metaphor is like magic; it can create or destroy possibilities, it can bring us together or tear us apart, it can constrain us or set us free.</p>
<p>In this sense, metaphor is much like belief; but metaphor engages us more deeply, more viscerally than a mere verbal understanding of a belief; it gives us something to hold on to, to relate to, an object in our imagination to manipulate and see from different angles; and it gives us the emotional traction to connect below the level of rationality. Metaphor in that sense gives us both an access to and a handle on our beliefs, and the power to transform them. It gives us the power to see new things and create common frames of view.</p>
