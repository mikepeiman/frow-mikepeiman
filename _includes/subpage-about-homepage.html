      <p><span class="dropcap-box dropcap-box-home"><span class="dropcap dropcap-home">A</span></span> natural philosopher. A spiritual being on a human journey. A father blessed with an amazing daughter and wife. A warrior, wildman, magician, king and lover, to name a few archetypes.</p>

    <div class="lph-4">
      <p>I've been through emotional hell - separation, mental illness and suicide attempts in my family. Addiction, exhaustion, anxiety and burnout.</p><p> By practicing mastery of self-awareness and personal responsibility, I've recovered, and made myself better and stronger thereby.</p>
      <div class="about-block-heading">
        <p>I want to help you overcome your challenges and rediscover your joy and purpose in life.</p>
      </div>
      <p>The challenges I've gone through have been central to my journey; they have become my teachers. The "dark nights of the soul" and "trials by fire" that I've experienced have taught me more than any teacher could.</p><p>They have taught me inner strength, revealed wisdom and purpose, and driven my journey to be a better man, to understand human nature and relationships, and to strive to make all things better. </p>
      <div class="about-block-heading">
        <p>I will share with you the things that have saved my health, my sanity, and helped me forge a positive and resilient mindset.</p>
      </div>
      <p>While I am driven to self-awareness, responsibility, and have ambitions to make a significant positive impact on the world, I also deeply appreciate the simple things in life.</p><p> I love quiet times by streams, reading books, playing games, making music. I love good food, coffee and cake. I love the companionship and play with those I love. I'm a hardcore snowboarder since 1994 and spent many seasons as an instructor, sharing the sport I love with others.</p>
      <div class="about-block-heading">
        <p>I can help you master your mindset, daily habits, and the dynamic balance of living to create a life of health, fulfillment, and achievement.</p>
