  <h1 class="greeting-about">Who's this guy?</h1>
  <p>I'm a proud father, freelance web developer, and master pancake-maker. Seriously, you should try my pancakes. But only with real maple syrup (none of that fake crap!)</p>
  <p>I'm also many other things. Honestly, defining myself in a few short paragraphs is one of the hardest things for me; I've tried many times over many years. But here are a few things about me to paint a picture:</p>
  <ul>
  	<li>I'm an expert-level snowboard instructor, a personal trainer, and a champion for health, wellness, and vitality.</li>
  	<li>I'm an advocate for sustainability, social and economic justice, and bringing a higher level of consciousness to life.</li>
  	<li>I've struggled with perfectionism my whole life, and am finally kicking the habit now. Just f***in' do it man!</li>
  	<li></li>
  	<li></li>
  <p></p>
